# Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Lending System

The project introduces a **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Lending Platform** that removes intermediaries like banks and enables direct **peer-to-peer lending, borrowing, and investing** using blockchain technology.  

The system combines **Ethereum smart contracts, Web3 wallet integration, and AI-driven assistance** to create a transparent, secure, and user-friendly platform.

### Key Features
- ✅ **Smart Contracts** (Solidity + Hardhat) – Automating lending, borrowing, and collateral management.  
- ✅ **Frontend (React.js + Tailwind CSS)** – Modern, responsive UI with wallet integration.  
- ✅ **Backend (Node.js + Express.js)** – REST APIs for user authentication and loan management.  
- ✅ **Database (MongoDB + IPFS)** – Hybrid storage for user and transaction records.  
- ✅ **MetaMask Integration** – Seamless Ethereum wallet connectivity.  
- ✅ **NFT Rewards** – Gamified participation using tokenized incentives.  
- ✅ **AI Chatbot** – Assisting users with platform navigation and DeFi concepts in real time.  
- ✅ **Chainlink Oracles** – Real-time crypto price feeds to calculate loan amounts and trigger liquidations.

- Direct **peer-to-peer lending** without intermediaries.  
- **Faster, transparent, and borderless** transactions.  
- **Inclusive financial access** for underbanked and marginalized communities.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Establish a transparent and decentralized financial ecosystem.  
2. Facilitate **peer-to-peer lending & borrowing** of assets without intermediaries.  
3. Enhance inclusivity by lowering costs and making finance accessible to all.  
4. Provide a gamified trust system using **NFT rewards** and **community-driven risk assessment**.  
5. Ensure system reliability through **smart contract audits** and decentralized identity checks.
